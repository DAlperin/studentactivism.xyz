### What is this page what are you doing?
Good question. We are advocating for actual gun control laws in America that keep everyone safe. Regardless of who they are, where they live, who they love, or the color of their skin. Here are our specific asks.

- Ban AR-15's and similar rifles
- Minimum age to buy a gun raised to 21 everywhere
- Mandatory background checks
- Mandatory 2 day waiting periods
- End stand your ground laws
- End concealed carry reciprocity

These asks are not unreasonable ones. Lets make them happen.
